# Dalmatia Fires Map

## Project Overview

The **Dalmatia Fires Map** project is aimed at tracking and visualizing fire incidents in the Dalmatia region. This project leverages data from Croatian fire reports to display incidents on an interactive map, providing valuable insights and real-time information.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: The script extracts fire incident data from the Croatian Firefighting Associationâ€™s website.
- **Date Filtering**: Allows fetching and processing data for specific date ranges.
- **Location Display**: Outputs cities and regions affected by the fires.

## Future Plans

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: 
   - **Fire Detection**: Implement machine learning models to automatically detect and classify fire incidents from satellite images or other data sources.
   - **Predictive Analytics**: Develop algorithms to predict potential fire outbreaks based on historical data and weather conditions.

2. **Enhanced Mapping**:
   - **Interactive Maps**: Create interactive maps with real-time updates using web technologies.
   - **Historical Data Analysis**: Integrate historical data to analyze fire trends over time.

3. **Data Collection and Analysis**:
   - **Data Aggregation**: Aggregate data from various sources to provide comprehensive reports.
   - **Insights Generation**: Use data analytics to generate actionable insights for firefighting strategies and prevention measures.
